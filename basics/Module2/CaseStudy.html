<h2>Chapter one</h2>
<p>
        Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,[1] through casual or <em>organised participation, </em>at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators.[2] Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of<em> simultaneous participants, </em>either in teams or competing as individuals. </p>
        
        <p><q>In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner;</q> in others, the contest <ins>(a match) </ins>is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
